## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. [DevDocs AI: RAG Q&A for Developer Docs](./DevDocs-AI-RAG-Chatbot/)
![DevDocs AI Demo](https://github.com/AnasSayed27/AI-ML-Portfolio/blob/main/media/RAG-GIF.gif)

A RAG-powered chatbot built from the ground up, featuring a **custom vector search engine** implemented with Python and NumPy. It ingests technical documentation and provides instant, accurate answers to complex queries.

- **Key Skills:** LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, FAISS (Vector Store), Streamlit, Embeddings, Prompt Engineering.
- **Result:** Achieved a ROUGE-L score of ~0.10, demonstrating a functional prototype for building specialized, fact-based Q&A applications.

### 2. [SubSlash AI: Autonomous Marketing Agent Swarm](./SubSlash-AI-Marketing-Agents/)
![SubSlash AI Agent Architecture](https://github.com/AnasSayed27/AI-ML-Portfolio/blob/main/media/Agent-Architecture.png)

A hierarchical **multi-agent system** built with **CrewAI** that simulates a full-service marketing agency. Four specialized AI agents (Strategy, Research, Content, SEO) collaborate asynchronously to plan and execute a Go-To-Market strategy for a FinTech product without human intervention.

- **Key Skills:** Agentic Workflows, CrewAI, Multi-Agent Orchestration, Google Gemini API, Task Delegation.
- **Result:** Automated the generation of a comprehensive market research report, content calendar, and viral social scripts in under 3 minutes.

### 3. [Potato Disease Classifier (Deep Learning & Web Deployment)](./CNN-Potato-Disease-Classifier/)
![Potato Disease Classifier Demo GIF](https://github.com/AnasSayed27/AI-ML-Portfolio/blob/main/media/CNN-GIF.gif)

A full-stack deep learning application that classifies potato leaf diseases from an uploaded image with **~92.66% accuracy**. The project showcases the complete MLOps lifecycle from model training in TensorFlow to deployment via a **FastAPI** web interface.

- **Key Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, FastAPI, HTML/CSS.
