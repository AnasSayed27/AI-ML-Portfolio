# AI & Machine Learning Project Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of AI and Machine Learning projects! This repository contains a collection of my work, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## About Me
I am an aspiring AI Engineering Student with a strong foundation in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning algorithms (both supervised and unsupervised), and core data science principles. I am passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects included in this portfolio. Each project is contained within its own folder and includes a detailed notebook and a specific README file.

### 1. [Customer Churn Prediction](./Customer-Churn-Prediction/)
- **Type:** Classification
- **Objective:** To predict whether a telecom customer will churn based on their account and usage data.
- **Key Skills:** EDA, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering (One-Hot Encoding), Model Comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall).
- **Result:** Developed a logistic regression model with 81% accuracy and a strong recall of 57% for identifying churners, making it the most effective model for this business case.

### 2. [Car Price Prediction](./Car-Price-Prediction/)
- **Type:** Regression
- **Objective:** To predict the selling price of used cars based on features like age, brand, and kilometers driven.
- **Key Skills:** Feature Engineering, EDA, Correlation Analysis, Model Building (Linear Regression, Random Forest), Model Evaluation (R², MAE, MSE).
- **Result:** The Random Forest Regressor model significantly outperformed the baseline, achieving an R² score of 0.69.
