SubSlash AI scans your statements, finds those forgotten subs, and negotiates cancellations FOR you. \n(Text overlay: 'SubSlash AI: Cancel anything, effortlessly.') \nVOICEOVER: Seriously, it's like having a personal assistant who *enjoys* arguing with customer service. \n(Final shot: User smiling, looking relieved, with the SubSlash AI logo prominent)",
