AI ethics is the study of moral principles guiding the design, use, and impact of artificial intelligence.
Fairness ensures AI systems do not discriminate against individuals or groups.
Algorithmic bias occurs when AI produces unfair outcomes due to skewed training data or flawed design.
Bias can enter through biased datasets, human labeling errors, or unbalanced model training.
Transparency means making AI decision processes understandable to humans.
Explainability helps users trust AI by showing how decisions are made.
Accountability ensures humans remain responsible for AI outcomes, not the machines.
Data privacy means protecting personal information used in AI training and deployment.
GDPR requires AI systems to handle personal data lawfully, fairly, and transparently.
Informed consent means users agree to how their data is collected and used.
AI safety focuses on preventing unintended harmful consequences from AI systems.
Narrow AI raises immediate ethical issues, while general AI raises long‑term existential risks.
Surveillance AI refers to systems that monitor people, raising privacy and civil liberty concerns.
Diverse teams reduce bias and create more inclusive AI systems.
Deepfakes are AI‑generated fake media that raise concerns about misinformation.
AI can generate realistic but false content, amplifying fake news.
Ethical AI design integrates fairness, accountability, and transparency from the start.
Human‑in‑the‑loop AI is an approach where humans oversee and guide AI decisions.
Oversight prevents harmful autonomous decisions and ensures accountability.
AI governance is the framework of policies and rules guiding responsible AI use.
Value alignment ensures AI systems act in line with human values.
Ethical data sourcing means collecting data legally, fairly, and without exploitation.
Algorithmic transparency means disclosing how algorithms work and what data they use.
The accountability gap is the difficulty of assigning responsibility when AI causes harm.
Autonomous weapon AI raises ethical debates about human control in warfare.
AI discrimination occurs when systems unfairly disadvantage certain groups.
Ethical auditing checks AI systems for fairness, bias, and compliance with laws.
An AI transparency report explains how a system was trained, tested, and deployed.
Ethical AI deployment means releasing AI responsibly with safeguards for fairness, privacy, and safety.
Explainability makes AI decisions understandable, while interpretability makes models simpler to analyze.
Ethical AI regulation refers to laws and policies that enforce responsible practices.
The EU AI Act classifies AI risks and regulates high‑risk systems.
Ethical AI research studies impacts and develops responsible methods for AI development.
AI should respect human rights such as privacy, dignity, and freedom.
AI accountability requires clear assignment of responsibility for outcomes.
Ethical AI requires balancing innovation with societal well‑being.
AI systems should avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes.
Responsible AI development includes testing for unintended consequences.
AI ethics emphasizes inclusivity in design and deployment.
AI should be designed to minimize environmental impact.
Ethical AI requires continuous monitoring after deployment.
AI should be accessible and beneficial to all, not just privileged groups.
Ethical AI requires clear communication of limitations and risks.
AI should support human decision‑making, not replace it entirely.
Ethical AI requires collaboration between technologists, policymakers, and society.
AI ethics involves anticipating long‑term consequences of technology.
AI should be designed to enhance human flourishing.
Ethical AI requires balancing efficiency with fairness and justice.
AI ethics emphasizes trustworthiness as a foundation for adoption.
Responsible AI requires ongoing dialogue between developers and users.
